## 🎯 Game Rules  

### 🧩 **The Basics**  
1. **Super Board**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards.  
2. **Winning a Mini-Board**:  
   - Just like regular Tic-Tac-Toe, align three of your symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) within a mini-board to win it.

### 🔄 **Gameplay**  
- **Turn Mechanics**:  
  - Players alternate turns, placing their mark (`X` or `O`) on the mini-boards.  
  - The cell you play in determines the mini-board your opponent must play in next.  
    For example, if you play in the top-left cell of your mini-board, your opponent must play in the top-left mini-board of the super board.  

- **Special Cases**:  
  - If a mini-board is already won or filled, the player can choose any open cell on the super board.
